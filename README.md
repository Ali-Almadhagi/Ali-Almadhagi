👋 Hi, I’m @Ali-Almadhagi, a computer science student with a passion for coding and learning new technologies.
👀 I’m fascinated by web development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, and how they can make the world a better place.
🌱 I’m pursuing a computer science degree at Eastern Michigan University as a junior and working on the Meta Web Development Certificate online.
